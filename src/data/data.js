        description: `This is not my personal story, nor is it the story of a specific individual, even though all its events are real. Each event or group of events pertains to this Palestinian or that one; the fiction in this work lies only in transforming it into a novel revolving around specific characters to meet the form and conditions of a literary work. Everything else is true; I lived much of it, and much of it I heard from the mouths of those who experienced it, along with their families and neighbors over decades on the land of Palestine.

Away from attempts to obliterate the truth and the darkness of imprisonment in the occupation's jails, 'Thorns and Cloves' aims to portray to the world the story of a people who have been wronged and continue to be wronged, to embody the reality on the land of Night Journey and Ascension; the complex Palestinian reality that only the people of the land fully understand.

I dedicate it to those whose hearts are attached to the land of Al-Aqsa, from the ocean to the Gulf, indeed from ocean to ocean.`,

        description: `A critical analytical book that addresses the phenomenon of 'modern freedom' from a deep critical perspective, revealing how the slogans of liberation and emancipation in the context of modern secularism have transformed into new tools of domination and masked slavery. The author deconstructs the prevailing concepts of individual freedom, value neutrality, and moral independence to show how modern humanity is controlled through subtle mechanisms such as consumption, cultural normalization, and targeted legislation. The book is a call to reflect on the meaning of true freedom and offers a comprehensive review of contemporary value systems in light of the established Islamic conception of dignity and servitude to God alone.`,

They wandered through the streets of Jerusalem and entered Al-Aqsa Mosque, with the aim of introducing the reader to its most prominent landmarks and acquainting them with the essential information that every Muslim must know. This is so that the goal of liberating Palestine and Al-Aqsa Mosque becomes a central cause carried by generations.

In its conclusion, we raised the banner of "Umarīyūn" (followers of Umar) for our readers to follow. So, welcome to the youth of the future in the procession of the Umarīyūn...`,

        description: `Tracking the daily influx of news and the ensuing public debate, following the successive series of intellectual extremisms, jurisprudential deviations, and intellectual commentaries proliferating on social media, and being drawn into pursuing intellectual trivialities and minor issues while continuously gazing in anticipation of their mutual bickering and vexations—unconsciously revolving in such a vortex, especially via the ever-present smartphones—gradually leads a person to disconnect from the spirit of action, implementation, and productivity. It fosters a feeling that merely watching and commenting is the natural state for a student of knowledge or a reformer.

Addressing this issue is complex. We need scholarly, intellectual, and advocacy figures who have a detailed, documented stance on the problem of excessive immersion in following events—a stance that can be considered an "intellectual model." Simultaneously, we lack direct experience of part of these figures' journeys to draw upon in sustaining the motivation that is often weakened by deep involvement in fleeting affairs (al-mājiriyyāt).

In this book, we will attempt to outline the governing boundaries of this study. Then, we will jointly examine the status of al-mājiriyyāt (fleeting, trivial matters) in the perspective of Muslim scholars. Subsequently, we will move to discussing networked al-mājiriyyāt (i.e., on networks/social media), modern studies concerning them, and their relationship with the student of knowledge. As for political al-mājiriyyāt, we will try to understand them by studying models of serious, productive scholarly and intellectual figures who had a position on this problematic issue.`,

        description: `On the eve of bidding farewell to the nineties, the Islamic internal sphere—through its publications and specialized seminars—was abuzz with extensive discussions and diverse treatments regarding the need for renewal and the legitimacy of revision. There was an eager welcome for any theses or invitations in this context. These theses, for the most part, were affiliated theses that adhered to Sharia standards, presenting renewal with the aim of enhancing the Islamic presence and extending it to new areas—not renewal aimed at displacing religious content or diminishing its existence. However, after the events (of September 2001), the tone of the renewal discourse began to change its warmth, although it still revolved within the conditions of the Islamic internal sphere. By the time Baghdad fell at the beginning of (2003), many banners of affiliation had already fallen, and many of those renewal voices had withdrawn from the Islamic internal sphere to an entirely different camp. It is true that there are still renewal figures who maintain their religious steadfastness and political independence—and they are many, praise be to God—before whom one stands with sincere reverence. However, we must clearly acknowledge that matters have evolved with many pens of civil discourse towards painful outcomes, where an observer’s eyes almost whiten with sorrow as they witness their growing recklessness! Many of those youthful, vibrant energies that began their journey with warm, da’wah-inspired language have today—and alas—adopted explicit secular positions, practically neutralizing the role of religious text in public life, immersed in opposing religious fatwas and causing disruption around them. They have been dragged into playing the role of court scribes, squandering their dignity and composing flattery, becoming irritable with faith-based language and ridiculing it, avoiding the metaphysical dimension in interpreting events. Some have even gone as far as to express objections reflecting deep anxiety about major existential questions. This segment has replaced the reference to evidence with the reference to permissibility wherever found, regardless of whether it fulfills the divine purpose or not. They have shifted from being concerned with developing Islamic discourse to politically betraying it, commenting behind every security incident with inciting language against everything Islamic, and have become obsessed with unjustly linking events of violence to da’wah institutions.`,

Book One: From Today, You Will No Longer Avoid Your Child's Awkward Questions

Why do our children ask questions? Are answers to awkward questions beneficial for my child, or do they harm and corrupt their mind? What are the consequences of parents not respecting their child's questions? How do I handle my child's awkward questions? How do my child's awkward questions shape them into a creative child? And what are the characteristics of successful answers to awkward questions regarding faith, sexual matters, and other topics?... In the pages of this book, you will find answers to these questions and many more...

Book Two: A Guide for the Perplexed in Answering Young Children’s Questions

In this book, we provide a practical guide for answering children's awkward questions. The development of this guide took nearly two years, during which we collected children's awkward questions from parents through direct surveys during various lectures and seminars. After gathering the questions, the most important and frequently asked ones were selected, totaling 65 questions. We provided answers that combine practical and theoretical aspects. As you read this guide, note that most answers are ideas and suggestions. If anything contradicts a correct religious principle or a established scientific rule, do not adopt it. Read the answer, think about it carefully, and then convey it to your child.`,

However, the process of piecing them together ultimately provides us with a coherent understanding of what happened a century ago and what is happening as an inevitable consequence, from the Gulf states to the farthest reaches of the Maghreb.

This effort deserves the appreciation it merits, as it is fundamentally rooted in a kind of moral commitment before a political one. The narrative proposed by the author is completed with the assembly of the mosaic pieces into the overall picture, offering us—in a style closer to that of journalistic writers—texts that are understandable and digestible for a wide audience that academic historians often fail to reach. This, too, is worthy of appreciation.`,

Observers quickly realized that these new ideas in our jurisprudential climate draw their material in the evening from the Arab modernist library and spread in the morning through local press. Among the heaps of these modernist programs for interpreting heritage, there is a subtle thread that has not been sufficiently captured and highlighted: the question of where Arab modernists sourced this raw heritage material during their reading and interpretation of Islamic heritage? In truth, after studying (modernist interpretation of heritage) projects, it became clear to me that they derived their foundational material and analyses from the works of Orientalists, especially those Orientalist works formulated through philological methodologies.

I remained captivated for some time by this relationship between (modernist interpretation of heritage) and (philological Orientalism), following it and marveling at its strength. Whenever I grasped one thread of this relationship, another would dangle before me; thus, I resolved to present this finding in a proven and detailed format. Exploring and analyzing this underemphasized relationship between (modernist interpretation of heritage) and (philological Orientalism) is the research question of this book before you, where I will attempt to shed light on the lines of communication between these two interpretations.`,

        description: `The Tunisians are people of seriousness and hard work.
They possess great gentleness and good manners, are deeply committed to religion, and highly protective of honor. So much so that if you see their women on the road, you would think they are moving specters, as nothing of them is visible at all.
I marveled at how they even see the road!!!

Women among them rarely go out to the markets, and most of those who do are elderly. As for the houses, you hardly hear a whisper inside, as if they are devoid of ladies altogether.

Dancers, singers, and the like are all from among the Jewish women, with absolutely no Muslim women among them.
This, by my life, is a characteristic that distinguishes Tunisia from many Eastern countries.`,

How beautiful it is for your eyes to fall upon a book illuminated by the light of revelation, calling out to innate human nature, rescuing it from the rubble, and reviving it so that it may pulse with life anew…

A book that builds in the Muslim girl and woman pride in her religion, strength in her character, clarity in her thinking, tranquility in her soul, and fortifies the fortress of the family against the assaults launched upon it in this day and age…`,

        description: `Through it, the believer’s faith increases, and the doubter and the atheist find within it—through diving into the depths of the human being, contemplating the grandeur of the universe, and pondering the miracle of the Qur’an—what quenches the thirst for proofs and evidence of the existence of God, the Lord of all worlds. Thus, faith becomes firmly established until it reaches—in this worldly life—the degree of excellence (ihsan), and its possessor ascends—in the Hereafter—to the highest ranks of Paradise.

So, O esteemed reader, I ask you—whatever your belief may be—to take the issue of faith with all seriousness, for it is a matter of destiny; upon it depends either everlasting misery or eternal happiness.

And remember that believing in the existence of God is an innate disposition in the human soul and a necessary conviction that a person attains as a fruit of his intellectual faculties. It has become one of the self-evident truths upon which humanity has agreed—through its prophets, scholars, philosophers, and sages... and only the deviant among people throughout history have denied it. So is it conceivable that we should ignore this immense amount of arguments and proofs and consider all those wise believers to be fools and gullible ones?!`,

Indeed, the Quran is Allah's message to us, the enduring, transmitted legacy from the miracles of prophethood, and every Muslim who hopes for guidance must contemplate its verses in moments of solitude, stillness, and various occasions.

The book’s dialogues and chapters unfold with different surahs, starting from Surah Al-Fatiha and Al-Baqarah, passing through Al Imran, Al-An'am, and Al-A'raf, and moving through Surah Yusuf, Al-Qasas, Ar-Rum, and Fussilat, ultimately reaching the concluding surahs of Al-Falaq and An-Nas.

The narrative of the dialogue feels as though it is your personal experience in understanding the Quran and reflecting on its meanings, where enlightenment from Allah descends in the form of understanding and its blessings, in harmony with reality and contemporary human life. So, come, let us contemplate the Quran for a while.`,

The influence of the Quran is not only on souls and hearts but also its external impact on the limbs. The limbs themselves tremble and shake upon hearing the Quran—a wondrous shiver that runs through a person’s joints when they hear the Quran.

The book is divided into: an introduction and ten chapters: The Majesty of the Quran, Reflect… How They Were Awestruck, The Stations of the Ashʿarites, Hearts of Stone, The Distracted, Lengthening the Path, From the Realms of Contemplation, The Entire Method in the Mother of the Book, The Resonance of Ramadan Nights, The Unifying Thread in the Book of God, and a conclusion addressing the Quran in our lives.

The guidance has been designed in a simple and easy manner to help the reader live with it, as follows:

1. Each verse is placed on a separate page, written in the Uthmani script, with the relevant guidance listed beneath it.

This question continues to occupy the minds of many, and its discussion is renewed over the days and years... Thus, I saw it as my duty to dedicate a brief message to it, refuting atheistic doubts and presenting the answer of Islamic doctrine on this issue—especially since this matter is among the greatest issues of faith that occupy human thought, and in which neglect or delay in clarification is not permissible. I ask Almighty God to lift ambiguity through this effort, plant certainty, and renew the faith of Muslims and those in doubt... Our final call is: Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.`,
